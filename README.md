# Custom Chocolate Pack Builder

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a feature that allows customers to build a custom pack of chocolates. The custom pack should consist of up to 8 items, with the price calculated automatically based on the selected products.

## Requirements

1. **Selection of Chocolates**: Enable customers to select a combination of chocolates for their custom pack.
2. **Item Limit**: Ensure that the total number of chocolates in the custom pack does not exceed 8 items.
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Display the total price of the custom pack, which should update automatically based on the selected items and their respective quantities.
4. **User Interface**: Develop an intuitive and responsive user interface to facilitate the selection and customization process.
5. **Explanation**: Provide a brief explanation of your approach, including any tools or frameworks used, and the reasoning behind your choices.

## Approach

We will build this custom chocolate pack builder using [insert your choice of programming language and framework, e.g., JavaScript and React]. Here's the high-level approach:

- **Frontend Development**: We will create a user-friendly frontend interface using [insert your choice of frontend technologies, e.g., React.js]. The user interface will allow customers to browse available chocolates, select their desired chocolates, and see the updated total price in real-time.

- **Backend Logic**: On the backend, we will implement the logic for calculating the total price based on the selected chocolates. This will involve managing the state of selected items, their quantities, and updating the price accordingly.

- **Item Limit Validation**: We will enforce the item limit of 8 items and provide user feedback if they try to exceed this limit.

- **Responsive Design**: We will ensure that the user interface is responsive, making it accessible on various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Testing**: We will thoroughly test the application to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.

- **Documentation**: We will provide clear documentation on how to use the custom chocolate pack builder and explain any technical decisions made during development.
